            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               I am an engineer who has been studying in the area of aircraft engineering for more 
               than six years. Going from the basic conception of a biplane aircraft of the soviet 
               union era (Antonov 2) to a more modern and very famous plane such as the A320. During 
               my Bachelor, we broke down a lot of aspects of aircraft engineering, from operation, 
               through maintenance and ending to repair, from structural checks, systems maintenance 
               to the electric and electronic parts. As reliability is the key for the air 
               transportation, which is based on probability and statistics, throughout my 
               academic career, I have developed some great skills in data analysis, which helped me 
               for my apprenticeship in ATR/Airbus back in 2020.

                  <p class="info">Data Analyst <span>&bull;</span> <em class="date">September 2019 - September 2020</em></p>

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                     My main experience was as a data analyst at ATR, I was in charge of analysis of a large dataset of aircraft 
                     maintenance reports. ATR, as they are aircraft designer and constructor, have multiple partnerships with other 
                     companies. Some of those companies are MRO (Maintenance Repair Overhall), those kind of companies have the 
                     role of doing the maintenance of aircraft.
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
                     In the aircraft industry, every modifications, every step linked to any process that concerns an aircraft 
                     is recorded and so ins the process of aircraft maintenance. In one hand, the EASA, an European authority, 
                     that is in charge of the regularization of aircraft design, construction, operation issues most of the 
                     constraints that should be applied on every type of aircraft (in Europe) . In the other hand, aircraft 
                     manufacturer such as Airbus or ATR, issues the documentation that concerns the process linked to their
                     specific aircraft. Just to name a few of them:
                  </p>
                     <ul style="list-style: square inside; margin-left: 20px">
                        <li>MRBR: Maintenance Review Board Report</li>
                        <li>MPD: Maintenance Planning Document</li>
                        <li>IPC: Illustration Part Catalog</li>
                     </ul>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                     The aircraft industry has a very strict regulation, and that resulted to a very high level of safety 
                     (Air transportation being the safest way of traveling). So back to my work, I had to retrieve every kind 
                     of information that could be used from these reports. The reports themselves included: the maintenance 
                     duration, the default description, the parts changed, the tasks. So, from those information, I could get 
                     a model of maintenance cost over aircraft age, redundancy of defaults, and most costing tasks.

                     This project was about studying the characteristics of the interface made with metal and elastomer, working mainly with 
                     Matlab, I worked on image processing to do measurement. 
                  </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">
                     During the first part of the project, we would test and measure the elastomer characteristics with an elastic sample on a specific stand, with 
                     specific software, and taking picture at the same time. Then, measure the elongation of that elastomer 
                     sample on Matlab with <b>image processing</b>. The next step is to compare the software measurement with the matlab results. For second part of 
                     the projects, we would them do the same operation but only with different kind of samples, an elastomer stuck with a 
                     piece of metal. This would allow us understand the <b>behavior of the bound</b> between the metal and the elastomer.
                     And for the second part, we would use different samples, with different artificial aging process. That 
                     part allowed us to measure the effect of aging for the interface and let us know how does it behave with time.

               About my communication skills, I am someone that is more about listening than speaking but I have a <b>good presentation</b> both 
               speaking and wirting. Also, I feel comfortable whenever I need to do <b>public speaking</b>. <b>Adaptation</b>, <b>great desire to learn</b> and 
               <b>good creativity</b> are the words that can describe me the most. For me, life is about learning new things everyday, discovering 
               so much knowledge, cultures. We never stop learning, and there is no limit for it. When working, I like doing my research, 
               and think logically with flexibility. Whenever there is an issue, I like doing the <b>troubleshooting independently</b> since I like 
               being independent. Last but not the least,  collaboration, although I like being independent, <b>collaboration is the key</b> for 
               a team success, and when it is needed I am always happy to join.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               As I mentioned earlier, I am actually doing a reconversion from being an aircraft engineer to be a data scientist. I have 
               chosen it because, I want to transfer what I have learned during my apprenticeship to be the basis of my career objectives. 
               At this time, I can work with the following programming languages:
               <ul style="list-style: square inside; margin-left: 20px">
                  <li>Python with advanced level on OOP conception, hardware acceleration with multithreading and multiprocessing;</li>
                  <li>Matlab with a good level in scripting;</li>
                  <li>VBA/Excel for automation of Excel sheets;</li>
                  <li>SQL for queries from databases.</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
               With Python as my main tool, I can work with the following frameworks:
               <ul style="list-style: square inside; margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;">
                  <li>Pandas, NumPy, OpenPyxl, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PySpark for data acqusition, data wrangling, data mining;</li>
                  <li>Scikit Learn, StatsModels, Pytorch for machine learning modeling;</li>
                  <li>Jupyter Notebooks, VSCode, GitHub as IDE platform for CI/CD;</li>
                  <li>Bokeh, MS Office, Canva for data vizualization and reporting;</li>
                  <li>Linux(Debian Based), Windows as OS and work environment.</li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
               As an aircraft engineer, I have acquired a very rich knowledge on the technical part of aircraft:
               <ul style="list-style: square inside; margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;">
                  <li>working with <b>aircraft documentation</b> such as the EASA Part 21, CS 25;</li>
                  <li>working on <b>continuous airworthiness management</b>;</li>

                              Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is
                              to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
                              If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
